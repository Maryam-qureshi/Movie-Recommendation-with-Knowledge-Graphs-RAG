# Movie-Recommendation-with-Knowledge-Graphs-RAG
We present a movie recommendation system that leverages a rich Knowledge Graph (KG) of movie metadata, user–movie interactions, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for natural‐language explanations. We then integrate an LLM (Dolly) to generate human-readable rationales.
